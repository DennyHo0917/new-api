# AGENTS.md — Project Conventions for new-api

DO NOT send optional commentary

## Overview

This is an AI API gateway/proxy built with Go. It aggregates 40+ upstream AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Azure, AWS Bedrock, etc.) behind a unified API, with user management, billing, rate limiting, and an admin dashboard.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.25.1 (see each module’s `go.mod`), Gin web framework, GORM v2 ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 (the only production database and the only required database test target)
- **Cache**: Redis (go-redis) + in-memory cache
- **Auth**: Browser sessions, API tokens and personal access tokens, JWT, WebAuthn/Passkeys, TOTP, OAuth/OIDC; Casbin authorization in `service/authz/`

## Architecture

- The Go gateway handles management APIs, upstream relay, billing, and background tasks across `router/`, `middleware/`, `controller/`, `service/`, `model/`, and `relay/`.
- `relaykit/` is an independent Go module for protocol DTOs and conversions; transport, authentication, database access, and billing stay in the host.

## API Route Takeover & Deployment Boundaries

- This project is the self-hosted backend for the existing API Route distribution frontend.
- Production frontend source at `D:\project\api-route-deploy` is read-only. Do not modify it. If a diagnostic or rollback operation requires touching it, create a reversible backup first and obtain explicit user approval.
- The editable frontend is `D:\project\api-route-deploy-new`. Frontend changes belong there unless the user explicitly expands the scope.
- The New API backend is `D:\project\api-route`. Local code may be inspected, tested, and modified here.
- Git pushes for this project and its editable frontend MUST use remotes under the GitHub account `DennyHo0917`. When the configured remote already belongs to `DennyHo0917`, push directly without asking the user to choose an account.
- The VPS is `149.88.86.52`. Configuration-only access is authorized when the user requests it: agents may log in to manage environment variables, deployment secrets, service configuration, and verify service health. Agents MUST NOT edit application source code or deploy code files directly on the VPS; backend code releases are performed only by pushing approved changes to GitHub and allowing the existing VPS automation to deploy them. Back up configuration before changing it, keep credentials out of command output and commits, and limit service restarts to those required to apply the requested configuration.
- Whenever the editable frontend is started locally for user inspection, use port `5173` and proxy backend requests to the real VPS through `https://origin.api-route.com`; do not use a local backend or the bare VPS IP, because Nginx routes the backend by hostname.
- Never write SSH passwords, session cookies, API keys, wallet secrets, database credentials, or other live credentials into source code, `AGENTS.md`, `todolist.md`, backups, test fixtures, logs, or commits. Read them from environment variables or the deployment secret store.
- Any release must preserve the zero-capital migration rule: legacy SubRouter balances are never copied into local spendable quota. Legacy keys continue through SubRouter until an upstream quota-exhausted response is observed; only then may subsequent requests use local quota.
- Before changing migration or routing behavior, update `todolist.md`, add focused regression coverage, and verify rollback behavior. Do not mark a task complete based only on compilation or a mocked upstream response.

## Rules

### Task Progress & TodoList Management (Mandatory / 任务管理强制约束)

- The development plan and task items for taking over `api-route-deploy` are strictly maintained in `todolist.md`.
- **Mandatory Progress Tracking**: Whenever any task item or subtask in `todolist.md` is implemented, verified, or completed, the agent MUST immediately update `todolist.md`, marking the corresponding item from `[ ]` to `[x]` (and noting completion details/commit references where appropriate).
- An agent MUST NOT proceed to subsequent tasks without keeping `todolist.md` accurately updated.

### Common Code Quality

- New code should stay direct and readable. Prefer early returns, clear branches, and well-named local variables to deep nesting or layered control flow.
- Minimize nested function definitions. Use them only when required by a callback API or when keeping the closure local is clearly simpler than adding another symbol.
- Avoid adding package-level or module-level helper functions that have only one caller and do not express a stable business concept. Inline that logic at the call site instead.
- A separate function is appropriate when it represents reusable behavior, a required interface/framework callback, an exported API, a test fixture, or complex business logic that deserves direct tests.
- If a single-use helper is kept, its name must describe a durable domain concept rather than a mechanical step extracted only to shorten the caller.

### Authentication Security (OWASP Mandatory)

- Any implementation, modification, or review involving authentication-related flows MUST comply with the applicable requirements of the latest stable [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) and the relevant [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/). This applies to both backend and frontend changes, including registration, login/logout, password changes and recovery, email verification, MFA, WebAuthn/Passkeys, OAuth/OIDC, account linking/unlinking, sessions, JWTs, API credentials, and re-authentication for sensitive actions.
- Before changing these flows, read the applicable OWASP guidance, starting with the [Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html) and [Session Management Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html). Consult the password storage, forgot password, MFA, OAuth, and CSRF guidance when those mechanisms are involved. Identify the applicable controls before implementation; existing code is not a justification for retaining or introducing an insecure pattern.
- Enforce security controls on the server. Apply the relevant requirements for credential storage and transport, resistance to account enumeration and brute force, CSRF and replay protection, token/challenge expiry and single use where required, protocol-specific verification, session rotation and invalidation, and re-authentication for sensitive account changes. Frontend checks MUST NOT substitute for server-side enforcement, and recovery or alternative login paths MUST NOT bypass the required authentication assurance.
- Authentication audit events MUST exclude passwords, verification codes, recovery codes, private keys, and usable session or authentication tokens. Record enough non-secret context to investigate authentication failures and sensitive account changes.
- Verify affected security controls with focused regression tests, including applicable failure, expiry, replay, and bypass cases, following the existing backend/frontend test conventions. Record the OWASP references (including the ASVS version and requirement IDs when used), validation performed, and any unresolved gaps in the change summary or PR description. Do not claim compliance or completion while an applicable security requirement remains unmet or unverified.

### Backend Rules

**Go conventions:** Follow the Go version declared in the relevant `go.mod`, keep code direct and readable, run `gofmt`, and remove unused imports.

**relaykit module independence:** The `relaykit/` Go module MUST remain independently buildable.

- Code under `relaykit/` MUST NOT import or depend on packages from the root `new-api` module, or rely on root-only configuration, generated files, or workspace wiring.
- Any change affecting `relaykit/` or its public APIs MUST be verified with `cd relaykit && GOWORK=off go build ./...`; a successful root-module build is not sufficient.

**JSON package:** In the root Go module, all JSON marshal/unmarshal operations MUST use the wrapper functions in `common/json.go`:

- `common.Marshal(v any) ([]byte, error)`
- `common.Unmarshal(data []byte, v any) error`
- `common.UnmarshalJsonStr(data string, v any) error`
- `common.DecodeJson(reader io.Reader, v any) error`
- `common.GetJsonType(data json.RawMessage) string`

Do NOT directly import or call `encoding/json` in business code. `json.RawMessage`, `json.Number`, and other type definitions from `encoding/json` may still be referenced as types, but actual marshal/unmarshal calls must go through `common.*`.

Inside `relaykit/`, use `kitutil.*` from `relaykit/relayconvert/kitutil/json.go`, never host `common`. Direct encoder calls belong only in codec implementations.

**Database:** This fork supports PostgreSQL 15 as its production database.

- Test only the database actually used by the deployment. SQLite and MySQL compatibility are not release requirements and must not block development or deployment.
- Changes affecting database behavior must be verified against a real PostgreSQL 15 instance. Schema changes must be tested on both a fresh database and a representative upgrade, including a second migration run to verify idempotency.
- Prefer GORM methods over raw SQL. PostgreSQL-specific SQL is acceptable when GORM cannot express the required behavior clearly.
- Record the PostgreSQL version and relevant verification results when database behavior changes.

**Relay and provider behavior:**

- When implementing a new channel, confirm whether the provider supports `StreamOptions`; if supported, add the channel to `streamSupportedChannels`.
- For request structs parsed from client JSON and re-marshaled to upstream providers, optional scalar fields MUST use pointer types with `omitempty` (for example, `*int`, `*uint`, `*float64`, `*bool`).
- Preserve explicit zero values in upstream relay request DTOs: absent client JSON fields must become `nil` and be omitted, while explicit `0`, `0.0`, or `false` values must remain non-`nil` and be sent upstream.
- Avoid non-pointer scalars with `omitempty` for optional request parameters, because zero values will be silently dropped during marshal.

**Billing expression system:** When working on tiered/dynamic billing (expression-based pricing), MUST read `pkg/billingexpr/expr.md` first. It documents the design philosophy, expression language, full architecture, token normalization rules, quota conversion, and expression versioning. All billing expression changes must follow that document.

**Billing safety invariants:** Quota/billing code MUST never produce a negative charge (a credit) from arithmetic overflow or unvalidated input. Apply defense in depth:

- Every user-controlled quantity that becomes a billing multiplier (image `n`, video `seconds`/`duration`, resolution/quality ratios, batch counts) MUST be bounded before it reaches quota calculation. Reject out-of-range values at request validation with a 400. Existing bounds: `dto.MaxImageN` for image generation count, `relaycommon.MaxTaskDurationSeconds` for task video duration, `maxTokensLimit` (`relay/helper/valid_request.go`) for `max_tokens`-family fields on every relay format (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Responses). Reuse these constants instead of introducing new ad hoc limits for the same concepts. When adding a new relay format or request DTO, bound its max-tokens and count fields in its validator from day one.
- Watch for validation bypass paths: passthrough fields (e.g. `Extra["parameters"]`), task `metadata` maps, and multipart form fields can carry the same quantities around the standard DTO validation. Any adaptor that reads a multiplier from such a path must enforce the same bound (or clamp) locally.
- Durations parsed from media metadata are user/upstream-controlled too: audio file headers (transcription token counting, TTS response duration) and upstream deduction numbers (e.g. Kling `FinalUnitDeduction`) can claim absurd values. Convert them with saturation before they become token counts.
- Never convert a computed quota or token count to `int` with a bare cast like `int(float64(quota) * ratio)`, `int(math.Round(...))` on unbounded input, or `int(decimal.IntPart())`. All quota rounding/conversion is centralized in `common/quota_math.go`; use those helpers: `common.QuotaFromFloat` (truncating) for float products, `common.QuotaRound` (half-away-from-zero) where rounding is intended, and `common.QuotaFromDecimal` for decimal products. `billingexpr.QuotaRound` delegates to `common.QuotaRound`. Do not reintroduce local conversion helpers or bare casts. Single-request saturation stays at the int32 boundary so batch accumulation cannot approach 64-bit wraparound; wallet/top-up conversion uses `common.WalletQuotaFromDecimalStrict` with the JavaScript-safe `common.MaxWalletQuota` boundary. Every clamp/NaN fallback is logged via `common.SysError`.
- Saturation events are also audited: each helper has a `*Checked` variant (`common.QuotaFromFloatChecked` / `QuotaRoundChecked` / `QuotaFromDecimalChecked`) that additionally returns a `*common.QuotaClamp` when clamping occurred. Billing paths that compute a charge capture that clamp onto `relayInfo.QuotaClamp` (or thread it into task settlement) and, right before writing the consume/task log, call `attachQuotaSaturation` (in `service/log_info_generate.go`) which nests the marker under the log's `other.admin_info.quota_saturation` and emits a request-correlated `logger.LogWarn`. Nesting under `admin_info` makes it admin-only for free (non-admin log views strip `admin_info`). When adding a new billing path, use the `*Checked` variant and surface the clamp the same way so the anomaly stays auditable in both the admin log UI and backend logs.
- Multiplier maps go through `types.PriceData.AddOtherRatio`, which rejects non-positive, NaN, and +Inf ratios. Do not write to `PriceData.OtherRatios` directly, and do not weaken these guards.
- Pre-consume (预扣费) and settle (结算/差额) must both be safe: a saturated oversized quota must fail pre-consume with insufficient-quota, never silently wrap. When adding a new billing path (new relay format, new task platform, new adjustment hook), trace the full chain — validation → EstimateBilling/OtherRatios → quota conversion → pre-consume → settle/refund — and confirm each step preserves these invariants.
- Fields parsed into unsigned types (`*uint`) accept huge positive JSON numbers (e.g. `18446744073686646784`, a wrapped negative); a `>= 0` check is not sufficient, an upper bound is mandatory.
- Regression tests for these invariants belong with the boundary they protect (request validators, converter helpers). See `relay/helper/openai_image_request_test.go`, `relay/common/relay_utils_test.go`, and `common/quota_math_test.go` for the expected style.

**Backend test quality:** Backend tests must protect real behavior, API contracts, billing/accounting invariants, data compatibility, or regression paths.

- **Do not scatter tests for a small change:** For a focused feature or fix, extend an existing suitable test file first. If a new test file is necessary, add at most one and consolidate the key regression cases there. MUST NOT create separate test files for the same small feature across `controller/`, `service/`, `setting/`, or other layers merely because its call chain crosses those layers. Do not repeat fixtures and assertions at each layer. Keep the cases compact and focused on observable behavior; the number of production files touched is not a reason to add more test files.
- Do not add tests that only improve coverage numbers, prove that code happens to run, or lock in implementation details without a user-visible or cross-module contract.
- Avoid fake fuzz/stress/smoke/performance tests built from random inputs, large loop counts, sleeps, timing comparisons, or log-only assertions.
- Avoid duplicate tests that exercise the same branch with different names but no new invariant.
- Avoid tests that force incorrect provider/protocol semantics into production code.
- Avoid tests that assert private constants, select-field lists, helper internals, or file layout when observable behavior is already covered elsewhere.
- Prefer deterministic table tests with explicit inputs and exact expected outputs.
- When tests need database, request context, user group, settings, or cache state, initialize that state explicitly inside the test fixture.
- New or substantially rewritten Go backend tests MUST use `github.com/stretchr/testify/require` for setup and fatal assertions, and `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` for non-fatal value checks.
- Avoid hand-written assertion helpers unless they encode a reusable project-specific invariant.
- When cleaning tests, preserve meaningful regression coverage. If a deleted test covered a real contract indirectly, replace it with a smaller test that asserts that contract directly.
